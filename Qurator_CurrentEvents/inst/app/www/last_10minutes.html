  <b>Previous ten minutes:</b> As the data on recent changes accumulate we provide summary statistics on edits made in the previous ten minutes and update the table below each minute. <b>NOTE.</b> If there is any item that was edited by at least three (3) editors, then it considered to be a <i>current event</i> and then all other edited items are filtered out; otherwise, all recently and frequently revised items in the previous ten minutes are shown.
