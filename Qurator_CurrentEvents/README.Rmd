# Wikidata Current Events

**Wikidata Current Events** tracks Wikidata revisions via the [Wikibase API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikibase/API) and lists the Wikidata entities that have received revisions by at least two (2) editors in the previous 72, 48, 24, and 6h.

The system tracks Wikidata revisions in almost real-time; the time lag is due solely to the time needed to aggregate the dataset following a Wikibase API call.

The dashboard cuts-off the number of top-ranked, displayed items to 100 in each (72, 48, 24, and 6h) table. The future versions will enable a download of complete datasets.
