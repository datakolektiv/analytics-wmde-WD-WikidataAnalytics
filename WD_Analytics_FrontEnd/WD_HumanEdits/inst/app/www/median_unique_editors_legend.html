  <b>The distribution of the Median Unique Human Editors per Wikidata Class. </b>
  The statistic is calculated as following: we first count the number of <i>unique human editors</i> for each Wikidata item, and then take the median of that number <i>in each Wikidata class</i>. The distribution of the median number of unique human editors per class is then binned and represented in the logarithmic space on this chart. The point labels report the bins alongside the exact counts.<br><br>
