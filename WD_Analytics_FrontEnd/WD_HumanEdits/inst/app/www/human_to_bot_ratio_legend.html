  <b>The distribution of the Human to Bot ratio statistic across the Wikidata classes. </b>
  The horizontal axis represents the logarithm of the <i>human to bot ratio</i>: the number of human edits divided 
  by the number of bot edits in the respective Wikidata class. Because we use logarithmic scaling, any value of 
  this statistics lower than zero - indicated by a dashed, vertical line in the chart - represents a human to bot 
  ratio lesser than one, i.e. classes with a higher number of bot edits relative to human edits. Wikidata classes 
  where there were no human or no bot edits at all are exluded.
