<a href = "https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T248997" target = "_blank">The Wikidata Game to deliver reference sets</a>.
The <b>Item x Property x Value Dataset</b> is probably the most relevant table reported here: it provides statistics per item, per property, and per extracted value for an item x property pair, of the decisions to accept or reject the suggested value. The <b>criterion</b> used to determine whether the proposed value would be accepted or not is defined <a href = "https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T253552#6227594" target = "_blank">in this Phab ticket</a>: (1) a proposed value can be accepted if it was reviewed by at least five (5) decision makers in the game, and (2) a proposed value is accepted if it has at least a 95% acceptance rate (implying that any proposed value up to 19 decisions must have a consensus to be accepted). The <b>is_accepted</b> column in the <b>Item x Property x Value Dataset</b> is based on this criteria. For reasons of clarity very long values in the <b>Extracted Data (JSON)</b> column in this table are truncated as indicated by <i>(...truncated...)</i> in this column. The complete dataset, with complete (i.e. non-truncated) values, can be downloaded as a .CSV file from the bottom of the table.<br>
The rest of tables provide aggregated statistics per Wikidata properties and datatypes. <br>
<b>Note.</b> We do not process the Wikidata external identifiers separately at this point because we still do not have enough decisions on them.
